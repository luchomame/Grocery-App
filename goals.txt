What is the plan for the grocery APIs?
  query them so you can get grocery prices
  Be able to say "hey how much are chicken breasts" and it searches kroger, publix, etc.
  compares prices and says "this play has the cheapest and this is the product"
  also be able to see the products at other stores
    lets start with kroger, then publix, then walmart

What is a must
  simple UI where I can use my phone app to do it
    plan to use react-native
  connect to APIs
    let each component call an API individually
      getKrogerPrices(), etc.
    have a master script run it and put all the resuts back together
  be able to search for stuff individually as well as put a list
  can save list

what would be nice to have ?
  maybe a database to hold the values
  add a refresh value
  make the UI better with graphs and shit but keep it simple for now
